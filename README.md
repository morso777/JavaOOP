# JavaOOP
Fundamentals of object-oriented programming Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object.

What Are Objects?
An object is an entity that has states and behaviors.

What Are Classes?
A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.


Principles of object-oriented programming
These are the four main principles of the object-oriented programming paradigm. Understanding them is essential to becoming a successful programmer.

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Abstraction
Polymorphism

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.

Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the states and behaviors of a parent object.

Abstraction:
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
